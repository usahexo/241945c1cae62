The odds of winning decrease as you add more numbers to your bet, so it’s important to make sure you’re comfortable with the odds before placing any bets.</p>
<p>There are a variety of betting options available in European Roulette, including straight up bets, split bets, street bets, and corner bets. You can find a complete list of all the available bets on the Casino Six website. In addition to the standard betting options, Casino Six also offers several bonuses and side bets that can increase your chances of winning. For example, the “even money” bet pays out 1:1 if your chosen number appears on the wheel, while the “red or black” bet pays out 1:1 if the ball lands on either red or black.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play"><a href="#How-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="How to Play"></a>How to Play</h2><p>To play European Roulette at Casino Six, first select your chip denomination and then click on the table where you would like to place your bet. Your chip will now be placed on that spot on the table. To remove your chip from the table, simply click on it again.</p>
<p>Once you have made all of your desired bets, click on “Spin” to begin the game. The ball will be spun around the wheel and eventually land in one of 37 slots. If your chosen number appears on the wheel, you will win 35 times your original bet amount! Note that some betting options (like even money) pay out automatically without requiring a spin.</p>
<p>European Roulette at Casino Six is a fun and easy-to-use game that offers players a variety of betting options and bonuses. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try today!</p>
