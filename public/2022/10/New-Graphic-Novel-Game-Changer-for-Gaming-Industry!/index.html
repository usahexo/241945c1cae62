Called “The Graphic Novel Game”, it is an interactive story that allows players to make choices that influence the outcome of the story.</p>
<p>The Graphic Novel Game was created by two gamers, Sean and John, who were tired of playing games that didn’t allow them to make choices that affected the outcome of the story. “We wanted to create a game where players could actually make a difference in the storyline,” Sean said. “So we came up with The Graphic Novel Game.”</p>
<p>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where players must make choices that will either help or hinder them in their quest to survive. The game features stunning artwork and an engaging story that will keep players hooked until the very end.</p>
<p>One of the best things about The Graphic Novel Game is that it is constantly evolving. Sean and John are constantly adding new storylines and features, so players never get bored. They have also created a fan forum where players can discuss the game and share ideas.</p>
<p>“We want players to feel like they are part of the game,” Sean said. “We want them to feel like they are impacting the outcome of the story.”</p>
<p>So far, reaction to The Graphic Novel Game has been overwhelmingly positive. Gamers are excited about finally having a game that allows them to make choices that affect the outcome of the story. With its engaging storyline and stunning artwork, The Graphic Novel Game is sure to revolutionize the gaming industry!</p>
<h1 id="This-Could-be-the-Game-that-Changes-How-Games-are-Played-Forever"><a href="#This-Could-be-the-Game-that-Changes-How-Games-are-Played-Forever" class="headerlink" title="This Could be the Game that Changes How Games are Played Forever!"></a>This Could be the Game that Changes How Games are Played Forever!</h1><p>There is a new game that is being developed that has the potential to change how games are played. This game is called “Phoenix” and it is being created by a company called Inversus.</p>
<p>Phoenix is a 4-player competitive shooter where each player controls a different color of ship. The goal of the game is to capture the enemy’s flag while trying to protect your own.</p>
<p>What makes Phoenix unique is its ability to switch between two different game modes. In “Normal Mode”, players battle each other on a normal plane. However, in “Inverse Mode”, the planes are flipped and the players must battle each other on the back of their ships.</p>
<p>Inversus has been in development for over two years and it has already been showcased at various gaming conventions including PAX East and EGX. The game has received some positive feedback from both gamers and critics alike.</p>
<p>The developers of Inversus are currently raising money for the game through Kickstarter. They are looking to raise $40,000 in order to help finish development of the game. As of this writing, they have raised over $27,000 with 29 days left to go.</p>
<p>If you are interested in backing this project, you can head over to their Kickstarter page and pledge your support. You can also check out their website or Facebook page for more information on Phoenix and Inversus.</p>
