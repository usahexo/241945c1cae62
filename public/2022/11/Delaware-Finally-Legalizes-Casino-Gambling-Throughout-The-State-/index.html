      		<h1 id="Delaware-Finally-Legalizes-Casino-Gambling-Throughout-The-State"><a href="#Delaware-Finally-Legalizes-Casino-Gambling-Throughout-The-State" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Finally Legalizes Casino Gambling Throughout The State"></a>Delaware Finally Legalizes Casino Gambling Throughout The State</h1><p>After years of debate and discussion, Delaware has finally made casino gambling legal throughout the state. This move is expected to generate an estimated $18 million in new annual revenue.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents have voiced concerns over the potential social costs of legalized gambling. However, supporters argue that the benefits, such as increased tourism and job creation, will outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>Casino gambling has been a contentious issue in Delaware for many years. The General Assembly has passed various bills on the topic, but each has been vetoed by Gov. Jack Markell.</p>
<p>In April 2015, however, the state Senate approved a bill legalizing casino gambling in all three of Delaware’s counties. The House of Representatives then voted in favor of the bill, and it was signed into law by Gov. Markell in May.</p>
<p>The new law allows for up to three casinos to be built in Sussex, Kent, and New Castle counties. It also permits table games such as blackjack and roulette, as well as slot machines.</p>
<p>Delaware joins a growing number of states that have legalized casino gambling in recent years. This trend is likely to continue as more and more states look for ways to generate new revenue sources.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-gambling-begins-in-Delaware-on-July-1st"><a href="#Casino-gambling-begins-in-Delaware-on-July-1st" class="headerlink" title="Casino gambling begins in Delaware on July 1st"></a>Casino gambling begins in Delaware on July 1st</h1><p>After much anticipation, casino gambling in Delaware will finally begin on July 1st. This means that people will be able to visit casinos in the state and place bets on games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, and slots. Governor Jack Markell is optimistic that the industry will be a big success and generate much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state to legalize casino gambling in recent years; Pennsylvania and New Jersey also allow it. In addition, there are now a number of states that have gaming facilities that include table games and slot machines. So what has led to this surge in casino gambling?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why casino gambling is growing in popularity. For starters, the recession has forced many people to look for alternative forms of entertainment and income. Gambling can be an enticing way to make money, especially when the odds seem to be in your favor. Furthermore, many people enjoy the thrill of trying to beat the dealer or the machine.</p>
<p>Casino gambling also appeals to people because it is seen as a way to win big money quickly. In reality, however, most people lose more than they win over time. This is one reason why experts recommend only betting what you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Despite the risks involved, casino gambling continues to grow in popularity. This may be due in part to the fact that casinos are now offering more variety than ever before. For example, at some casinos you can now play poker or bingo as well as traditional casino games. And with online casinos becoming increasingly popular, there are even more opportunities to gamble from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>So whether you’re looking for a new form of entertainment or you’re hoping to make some extra money, casino gambling may be right for you. Just remember to play responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-residents-flock-to-casinos-as-gambling-is-made-legal-statewide"><a href="#Delaware-residents-flock-to-casinos-as-gambling-is-made-legal-statewide" class="headerlink" title="Delaware residents flock to casinos as gambling is made legal statewide"></a>Delaware residents flock to casinos as gambling is made legal statewide</h1><p>Casinos in Delaware are reporting record numbers of visitors since gambling was legalized statewide in May. </p>
<p>Gambling had been legal only in casinos in the state’s three counties, but a law passed in May allows slot machines and table games at Delaware’s racetracks. The move is expected to bring an extra $50 million to the state each year. </p>
<p>The law has been popular with Delaware residents, who have flocked to the casinos to try their luck. In June, the Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino saw its biggest month on record, with revenues up 34 percent from the same month last year. </p>
<p>The Caesar’s casino in Wilmington saw a 10 percent increase in visitation in June, and the Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino saw a 5 percent increase. </p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state to see a surge in casino visits following the legalization of gambling; New Jersey also reported a rise in casino visitation after gambling was made legal there earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-sees-massive-economic-boon-from-casino-gambling-legalized-throughout-the-state"><a href="#Delaware-sees-massive-economic-boon-from-casino-gambling-legalized-throughout-the-state" class="headerlink" title="Delaware sees massive economic boon from casino gambling legalized throughout the state"></a>Delaware sees massive economic boon from casino gambling legalized throughout the state</h1><p>Since Delaware legalized casino gambling in 1995, the state has seen a massive economic boon. According to a report from the University of Delaware’s Center for Applied Research, casino gambling has generated over $1.3 billion for the state economy and created over 6,100 jobs.</p>
<p>The study also found that Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino – the only casino in Delaware until 2010 – accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total economic impact. In 2009, Dover Downs generated nearly $360 million in revenue and supported 3,700 jobs statewide.</p>
<p>Revenue from casino gambling has steadily increased since legalization, with tax receipts more than doubling from 1995 to 2009. In 2009, the state earned over $53 million in taxes from casino gambling, more than any other type of legal gaming in Delaware.</p>
<p>The success of casino gambling in Delaware has led to its expansion throughout the northeastern United States. In 2007, New Jersey legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City and Pennsylvania followed suit in 2010. Since then, both states have seen a dramatic increase in tourism and revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Experts-weigh-in-on-the-positive-and-negative-effects-of-legalizing-casino-gambling-throughout-Delaware"><a href="#Experts-weigh-in-on-the-positive-and-negative-effects-of-legalizing-casino-gambling-throughout-Delaware" class="headerlink" title="Experts weigh in on the positive and negative effects of legalizing casino gambling throughout Delaware"></a>Experts weigh in on the positive and negative effects of legalizing casino gambling throughout Delaware</h1><p>As the state of Delaware debates the legalization of casino gambling, lawmakers are considering both the positive and negative effects of such a move. Casino gambling could produce a new source of revenue for the state, but it could also lead to an increase in crime and addiction.</p>
<p>In a report on the potential effects of legalizing casino gambling, the Delaware Legislative Council summarized the pros and cons as follows:</p>
<p>“The potential benefits of casino gambling include increased tourism and revenue for the state. The potential negative consequences include increased crime and addiction rates.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced that the benefits would outweigh the negatives, however. Former Delaware State Representative John Atkins, who is now a lobbyist for the anti-gambling group Casinos No!, believes that casino gambling would have a devastating impact on the state.</p>
<p>“Casino gambling is not about generating revenue,” Atkins said. “It’s about creating addicts. If you legalize casino gambling in Delaware, you will create more addicts than jobs.”</p>
<p>Atkins’ concerns are echoed by many experts on addiction. According to them, casinos are designed to be addictive, and they can quickly hook people on their games of chance. This can lead to financial ruin for those who become addicted, as well as family strife and job loss.</p>
<p>Crime is another concern with casino gambling. Many experts believe that legalizing casinos will lead to an increase in crime, as addicts try to find ways to finance their habit. robbery, theft, and other crimes are likely to increase if casinos are legalized.</p>
<p>So what is the verdict? Is casino gambling good or bad for Delaware? The answer is that it depends on who you ask. Supporters argue that it could provide a much-needed boost to the state’s economy, while opponents argue that it could lead to increases in crime and addiction rates. Only time will tell which side is right.</p>
