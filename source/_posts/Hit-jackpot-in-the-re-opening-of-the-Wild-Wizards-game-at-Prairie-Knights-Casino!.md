#  Rejoice, Wild Wizards fans: the game is back at Prairie Knights Casino!

After a one-year absence from the casino, the popular casino game is back at Prairie Knights. The game, which pits players against the dealer in a race to draw cards totaling 21, was removed from Prairie Knights last year due to concerns about how it was being played.

"The game was not being played the way it was intended," said Prairie Knights spokesperson Stephanie Wilson. "We want to ensure that our guests are having fun and playing fairly, so we made the decision to remove Wild Wizards from the casino."

The game has been popular among casino guests, who have been asking for its return since it was removed. "I play Wild Wizards all the time," said casino guest Leroy Waters. "I'm glad it's back."

Wilson said that the game will be available in the casino's main gaming area. In addition, Prairie Knights will offer special promotions related to Wild Wizards in the coming months.
