#  Tyco execs sell slot machine to Santa

In a deal that has surprised many, executives from Tyco International have agreed to sell one of their slot machines to Santa Claus. The machine, which is said to be in excellent condition, was reportedly sold for a price of $100,000.

According to Tyco representatives, the company decided to divest itself of the machine in order to focus on its core business interests. "We're very proud of our slot machine," said one executive. "But at the same time, we realize that it's not our core area of expertise."

When asked about the sale, Santa declined to comment. "I'm just glad to have the machine," he said. "It's going to come in handy this year."

It is unclear what Santa intends to do with the machine, but some observers believe that he may use it to help him distribute Christmas gifts this year. Others believe that he may use it as a means of funding his operations at the North Pole.

Whatever Santa's plans may be, there is no doubt that the acquisition of the Tyco slot machine will be a major coup for him. It is also sure to raise eyebrows among competitors who are now wondering just what else Santa may have up his sleeve.

#  FBI investigating Tyco for sale of slot machine to Santa

Today, the FBI announced that it is investigating Tyco for selling a slot machine to Santa.

"Tyco is a responsible company that would not sell a slot machine to Santa," said CEO Edward Breen in a statement.

The FBI investigation comes after allegations that Tyco sold a slot machine to Santa for use at his North Pole workshop.

#  Who sold the slot machine to Santa?

In the wee hours of Christmas Eve, while children are asleep in their beds, visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads, a certain jolly bearded man is hard at work in his workshop. Santa is busy making toys!

But who supplied Santa with the raw materials to make those toys? It's a mystery that has puzzled researchers for years. Some say the elves do it all themselves, but others believe that someone else is responsible for getting the raw materials to Santa.

One theory is that the slot machine at the North Pole is responsible. That's right, some people believe that Santa gambles his way to toy-making success! Every night, he puts a few coins in the machine and spins the reels until he hits the jackpot. Then he goes to work making those toys.

This theory has been around for a long time, but there's no evidence to support it. In fact, there's no evidence to support any of these theories about how Santa gets his supplies. So who really knows how it all works? We may never know for sure - but it's certainly fun to speculate!

#  Tyco execs under investigation for selling slot machine to Santa

The Tyco Corporation is in the middle of a major scandal after several of its executives were caught selling a slot machine to Santa.

The machine, which was designed to dispense candy canes, was instead used by the executives to launder money.

Sources say that the executives bought the machine for $1 million and then sold it to Santa for $10 million.

This is not the first time that Tyco has been involved in a financial scandal. In 2002, the company was caught defrauding shareholders out of hundreds of millions of dollars.

In response to these latest allegations, the company's board of directors has launched an investigation.

A $5.5 million slot machine that was sold to Santa by two Tyco executives is now under investigation.
