#  John Lennon's Epiphone Casino 'Big Daddy' Casino Up for Auction

In 2015, the estate of John Lennon put his beloved Epiphone Casino ‘Big Daddy’ up for auction. The guitar was one of only two that Lennon ever owned, and is estimated to be worth between $600,000 and $800,000. The current owner is Matt Lee, a computer engineer from North Carolina, who purchased the guitar for just over $480,000 at the auction.

While the other Lennon-owned Casino (a 1964 model) is displayed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, the ‘Big Daddy’ has been kept out of the public eye for the most part since its purchase by Lee. He has only taken it out on a few occasions – once to play a set at a music festival in North Carolina and another time to show it off to friends at a party.

The story of how Lee came to own the guitar is an interesting one. He had initially intended to place a bid on it through an online auction, but when he went to place his bid, he found out that the auction had ended just minutes earlier. He was later told that someone had placed a last-minute bid for over $480,000 and won the guitar.

Lee says that he has no intention of selling the guitar any time soon. In an interview with Guitar World magazine, he said: “I’m not a Lennon collector; I’m not into Beatles memorabilia or anything like that. It’s just that when I saw this guitar I knew I had to have it. It’s one of those things where you see something once in your life and you know that you’ll never forget it. I plan on keeping it for as long as possible.”

#  John Lennon's Epiphone Casino 'Big Daddy' Casino Sells for $1.2 Million

The John Lennon “Big Daddy” Casino sold at auction for $1.2 million on June 14, 2018. The instrument is a 1965 Epiphone Casino that was played by Lennon during the Beatles’ “ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” era and beyond.

Lennon purchased the guitar in 1966 at Epstein’s Music Store in London and used it to record such hits as “Strawberry Fields Forever,” “Hey Jude,” and “ Revolution.”

In 2011, the guitar was appraised at $500,000, but it sold for more than twice that amount at Julien’s Auctions in Beverly Hills. The buyer was not identified.

The Casino is a semi-hollowbody electric guitar that has been popular among musicians since its release in 1961. It features two humbucker pickups and a trapeze tailpiece. Beatles guitarist George Harrison also played an Epiphone Casino during the band’s early years.

#  John Lennon's Epiphone Casino 'Big Daddy' Casino Found in Storage Unit

In a storage unit in Queens, New York, John Lennon's Epiphone Casino 'Big Daddy' was found. It is unknown how long the guitar has been in the storage unit, but it is in good condition. The guitar was used by Lennon during the early days of The Beatles and was last seen being played by Lennon at the Beatles final concert on January 30, 1969.

The guitar was not listed in Lennon's estate after his death and has been missing for over 40 years. It is not known how the guitar ended up in the storage unit, but it is believed to have been seized by the US government after Lennon's death. It is not clear why the government would have seized the guitar or why it would take so long to come to light.

The 'Big Daddy' Casino is a very rare instrument and is one of only two made with three P-90 pickups. The other 'Big Daddy' Casino is owned by Eric Clapton. The guitar will be put up for auction and is expected to sell for between $300,000 and $500,000.

The guitar, which was owned by John Lennon, is being auctioned off by Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills.

"This particular Casino is one of the most important guitars to ever come up for auction," said Darren Julien, founder and CEO of Julien's Auctions. "Not only did it belong to John Lennon during some of The Beatles' most iconic years but it is also one of only three known examples that were personally autographed by Lennon himself."

The Casino 'Big Daddy' is expected to sell for upwards of $200,000 when it goes up for auction on November 14th.
