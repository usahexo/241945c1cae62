#  Gibraltar Moves to Legalize Sports Gambling

The Gibraltar government is moving forward with a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the territory. The new law would allow operators to offer betting on sports events, both online and land-based. Gibraltar is hoping to attract more gambling companies to its shores as part of a broader effort to promote economic growth.

There are already a number of operators offering sports betting in Gibraltar, but the new law would give them official licensing from the government. This would provide some added protection for players, who can currently place bets with impunity.

The passage of the bill is seen as a victory for the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association (GBGA), which has been pushing for legalization for years. The GBGA has argued that sports betting is a legitimate form of entertainment and should be regulated like any other form of gambling.

The Gaming Board of Great Britain has also voiced its support for legalization, noting that it would provide much-needed revenue to UK gambling regulators. The GBGA has agreed to share 10% of its gross gaming revenue with the gaming board, which would help fund regulatory efforts.

Opposition to the bill has come from Spain, which sees Gibraltar as an illegally occupied territory. Officials in Madrid have threatened to block the legislation and take legal action against any operators who set up shop in Gibraltar.

Despite the threats, Gibraltar is moving ahead with the bill, which is expected to come into effect later this year.

#  Gibraltar Looks to Regulate and Tax Sports Betting

In a move that could provide a blueprint for other countries around the world, Gibraltar is looking to regulate and tax sports betting. The British Overseas Territory has been engaged in talks with the European Union over the past few months, with the latest development being a proposal to levy a 10% tax on gambling companies.

This would be in addition to the 20% corporate tax that Gibraltar currently charges. The hope is that this will not only bring in additional revenue but also help to protect consumers from the risks associated with gambling. Gibraltarian authorities are also keen to ensure that their regulated sports betting market remains competitive, which is why they are also proposing a licence fee of £100,000 for operators.

The move by Gibraltar comes at a time when more and more countries are looking to regulate sports betting. In the United States, for example, several states have moved to legalise sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban. Similarly, Ireland is considering similar measures, while Malta has already enacted legislation regulating the industry.

Gibraltar’s proposed tax would be considerably lower than that levied in other countries. For example, Malta charges a 35% tax on gaming revenues, while Denmark charges a 25% tax on gross profits from sports betting. It’s also worth noting that Gibraltar is proposing to exempt small-scale bookmakers from the tax, so as not to unduly burden them.

The proposal still needs to be approved by Gibraltar’s parliament, but it’s expected that it will pass without too much difficulty. This would then make Gibraltar the first British Overseas Territory to introduce a regulatory framework for online sports betting.

#  Gibraltar Seeks to Attract Online Gaming Companies with New Sport Betting Laws



Gibraltar is looking to attract online gaming companies with new sport betting laws. Gibraltar's current betting laws are outdated and do not allow for the same opportunities that other countries are offering. The new legislation will be more in line with what is happening in other countries and should help to bring more businesses to Gibraltar.

The Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, has been a big supporter of the new laws and believes that they will be good for the economy of Gibraltar. He stated, "This is an important day for Gibraltar as a modern commercial centre and we are delighted to be able to offer this new opportunity to our gaming industry."

The new laws will allow for betting on a wider range of sports events and will also make it easier for companies to operate in Gibraltar. There are already a number of online gaming companies that have located in Gibraltar, including PokerStars, bwin.party, BetVictor, and 888 Holdings. These companies have chosen Gibraltar because of its favorable tax regime and its well-regulated gambling industry.

There are some concerns that the new laws could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates, but the government is putting in place measures to address these concerns. These include prohibitions on gambling advertising and the use of credit cards for gambling purposes. The government is also planning to provide counselling and treatment services for those who develop gambling addictions.

#  Gambling Operators Eye Gibraltar as EU Sports Betting Hub

Gibraltar – A self-governing British Overseas Territory on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula and with a population of just over 30,000 people is looking to become a key hub for gambling operators looking to offer their services in Europe post-Brexit.

 Brexit has thrown up a lot of uncertainties for the gambling industry and one of the most pressing issues for operators is whether they will be able to continue to offer their services across the EU. Gibraltar, with its decades of experience in regulating the gambling sector and its close ties with the UK, is well placed to become a key player in the European gambling market.

One of the main attractions for gambling operators is Gibraltar’s membership of the European Union which means that companies licensed in Gibraltar can operate throughout the EU without having to obtain separate licenses in each country. This has been a big draw for online casinos and sports betting firms and many are now looking to relocate their operations to Gibraltar in anticipation of a hard Brexit.

The Gibraltar government has been busy trying to attract these businesses and recently held a roadshow in London aimed at promoting Gibraltar as an attractive destination for gambling companies. The government is offering a number of incentives to operators including tax breaks and simplified licensing procedures.

The recent success of Gibraltar’s online gaming industry has been due, in part, to its proximity to Spain and its good transport links with other parts of Europe. These factors are still important but with Brexit looming, Gibraltar’s close relationship with the UK could prove even more valuable for gambling operators.

#  Gibraltar Set to Legalize Sports Gambling as Part of Brexit Strategy

The British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar is on the verge of legalizing sports gambling in an effort to bolster its economy in the wake of Brexit.

The announcement was made by Gibraltar’s Deputy Chief Minister Joseph Caruana over the weekend, who said that the move would put his country in a better position to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the UK.

“There is no question that this is a more attractive option for us now that we are outside of the EU,” Caruana said.

Gibraltar has been self-governing since 1967, but is still considered part of the UK for international purposes. It is not clear what will happen to Gibraltar after Britain leaves the European Union next year, but Caruana says that he wants to see his country maintain its current close relationship with the UK.

“We want to be able to continue our close cooperation with the UK on issues such as security and defence, as well as our very successful economic relationship,” he said.

In order to preserve this relationship, Gibraltar will need to find new sources of revenue, and legalizing sports betting is seen as one way of achieving that goal. The government estimates that the move could bring in as much as £25 million ($32 million) in tax revenue annually.

Sports betting is currently outlawed in Gibraltar, but there are many online operators based in the territory who offer services to customers in other parts of Europe. If gambling is legalized, these companies will be required to obtain licences from the government and pay taxes on their profits.

The proposal has been met with mixed reactions from industry players. Some operators are supportive of it, while others have expressed concerns about increased regulation and higher taxes.

Regardless of the opposition, it looks likely that gambling will be legalized in Gibraltar in some form or another in the coming months. This could position the territory as a major player in the European sports betting market and provide a boost to its economy post-Brexit
