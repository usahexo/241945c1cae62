#  Nevada Becomes First State to Legalize Sports Betting

After the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) on May 14, 2018, Nevada became the first state to legalize sports betting.

The law will allow casinos in the state to offer bets on professional and college sporting events starting on July 1.

Under the new law, bettors must be at least 21 years old and physically present in Nevada to place a wager.

The move comes as a growing number of states look to cash in on potentially lucrative sports betting industries.

"There is an overwhelming demand for it," said Assemblyman William Horne, who sponsored the bill. "Nevada has always been the gold standard for gaming and I think this will just add to that."

Critics of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased instances of match-fixing and other forms of fraud.

#  Delaware legalizes sports betting in a bid to attract customers from neighboring states

The state of Delaware has passed a bill that legalizes sports betting in an attempt to attract customers from neighboring states.

The new law will allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer sports betting, subject to approval from the Delaware Gaming Commission.

"This is great news for Delaware," said Governor John Carney. "We are excited to offer this new product and bring more economic activity to our state."

This comes as good news for the struggling casino and racing industry in Delaware, which has seen a decline in revenue in recent years.

Sports betting is already legal in several neighboring states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. This has led to a significant amount of illegal sports betting in Delaware, as residents have been traveling to nearby states to place bets.

The new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state, which can be used to support important programs like education and healthcare. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs in the casino and racing industry.

#  Rhode Island legalizes sports betting, expecting $23 million in new revenue

Rhode Island became the latest state to legalize sports betting on Monday, with officials expecting the move to bring in an extra $23 million in revenue annually.

Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo signed the bill into law at Twin River Casino in Lincoln, saying it would help create jobs and boost tourism. The casino is one of two in Rhode Island, and will be the only place where residents can place bets on professional and college sports.

"This is about jobs and economic development," said Raimondo. "It's about giving people another reason to come to Rhode Island."

The bill had strong bipartisan support in the state legislature, with lawmakers estimating that it will bring in around $3.5 million in taxes each year. Officials say that the money will be used to fund new programs aimed at reducing casino addiction rates and promoting healthy lifestyles.

Rhode Island is the latest state to legalize sports betting, following a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the practice. Since then, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia and Pennsylvania have all legalized sports betting, while Connecticut and New York are considering similar measures.

#  New Jersey becomes third state to legalize sports betting

On Monday, New Jersey became the third state in the US to legalize sports betting, following Nevada and Delaware.

The legislation was passed in June but only came into effect on Monday, following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said that the move would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

"This is New Jersey's moment,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)" Murphy said. "We are proud to be the third state in the nation to offer legal sports betting."

The move is expected to generate $10 million in revenue for the state in its first year, and create thousands of jobs.

The legislation allows people over 21 years of age to bet on sports at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey. However, it remains illegal to bet on sports over the internet or through a smartphone app.

#  Iowa lawmakers advance bill to legalize sports betting

Iowa lawmakers have taken a step closer to legalizing sports betting in the state.

On Tuesday, the Senate Ways and Means Committee approved a bill that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks across Iowa. The bill must now be passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives before it can be sent to Governor Kim Reynolds for her signature.

If the bill is signed into law, Iowa would become the third state in the US to legalize sports betting, after New Jersey and Delaware. However, it is not clear how long it would take for Iowa's nascent sports betting industry to get up and running.

"It would be premature to speculate on when or if Iowans could place a legal bet on a sporting event," said Ben Kish, a spokesperson for the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC). "The legislation still has to make its way through both chambers of the legislature and receive the governor's signature."

Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state government. According to estimates from the IRGC, Iowa could earn between $13 million and $16 million in annual tax revenue from sports betting.

Casinos and racetracks are also eager to get their hands on this new source of revenue, as gambling revenues have been falling in recent years. In 2017, gambling revenues in Iowa totaled $1.48 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2016.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to more problem gambling, but proponents contend that this can be mitigated by sensible regulation.
