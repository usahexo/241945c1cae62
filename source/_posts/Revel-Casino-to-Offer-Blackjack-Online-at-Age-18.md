#  Revel Casino to Offer Blackjack Online at Age 18

# New Jersey casino set to offer online blackjack games in the state beginning on Thursday

# The games will be open to players 18 and older

The Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey will soon offer online blackjack games to players 18 and older within the state. The casino announced on Wednesday that the games will be available starting on Thursday.

“Atlantic City has always been a place for gaming innovation and we are proud to be the first to offer online blackjack in New Jersey,” said Michael Evans, president of operations for Revel. “This new offering underscores our commitment to provide our guests with an unrivaled gaming experience both on property and now online.”

The Revel Casino is one of three casinos in Atlantic City that will offer online blackjack as part of a pilot program authorized earlier this year by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The other two casinos are the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and Caesars Atlantic City.

#  New Jersey's Revel Casino to Offer Blackjack at Age 18

Atlantic City's Revel Casino announced this week that, starting in September, it will offer blackjack tables to guests 18 years and older.

The new policy is expected to bring in younger players and revive business at the ailing casino. The move comes after the state of New Jersey voted in February to increase the legal gambling age from 18 to 21.

Revel Casino is one of several Atlantic City casinos affected by the vote. The Trump Taj Mahal, Tropicana Atlantic City, and Caesars Atlantic City have all said they will not allow anyone under 21 to gamble on their premises.

Most other casinos in the city have said they will comply with the new law, but have not yet released details about how they plan to do so.
