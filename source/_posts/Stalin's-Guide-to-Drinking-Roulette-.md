#  The 5 Best Ways to Play Drinking Roulette Stalin 

Drinking Roulette, also known as Russian Roulette, is a drinking game that involves a revolver with a single bullet. The game is played by spinning the cylinder of the revolver, pointing the barrel at oneself, and pulling the trigger.

There are several different ways to play Drinking Roulette. One popular way is to assign drinks to certain numbers on the wheel. So, for example, if you were playing with 6 players, drinks would be assigned like this: 
1 drink - player selected number 1 
2 drinks - player selected number 2 
3 drinks - player selected number 3 
4 drinks - player selected number 4 
5 drinks - player selected number 5 
6 drinks - player selected number 6 
If you select a number that has already been consumed, then you drink again.

Another popular way to play is by using forfeits. So, for example, if you select the number 5 and it has already been consumed, then the person who previously chose 5 would have to do something that has been agreed upon before the game started (e.g. take a shot of liquor). 

A third way to play is to make it more challenging by giving each player 2 shots instead of just one. And finally, another way to make it more challenging is to place bets on which number will be chosen.

### How to Win at Drinking Roulette Stalin

So you want to be the life of the party and know how to win at drinking roulette? Stalin has all the tips and tricks you need to make sure that you come out on top.

First and foremost, it’s important to understand the game. In drinking roulette, there are typically six players - two teams of three. Each player is given a shot glass, containing vodka or any other spirit, and one empty glass. Players then take it in turns to spin a bottle on a table, with the person the bottle lands pointing at having to drink their shot glass. The team who finishes their shots first wins the game.

There are a few ways to win drinking roulette: either by finishing all your shots before your opponents do, or by forcing them to drink all their shots. The first way is pretty straightforward - just drink as fast as you can and hope your opponents can’t keep up. The second way is a bit more sneaky - you can try to distract your opponents so they don’t realise when their last shot is due. Here are a few tips for winning at drinking roulette Stalin style:

1) Try to choose an opponent who doesn’t seem too confident. This way, they might be more likely to rush their shots and make mistakes.

2) When it’s your turn, take your time spinning the bottle - make sure your opponents are watching you carefully. Then quickly down your shot and spin the bottle again.

3) If someone is looking like they might win, try heckling them or making fun of them until they mess up. This should give you enough time to finish your shots.

4) If all else fails, bribe your opponents with alcohol or money - anything goes in order to win!
