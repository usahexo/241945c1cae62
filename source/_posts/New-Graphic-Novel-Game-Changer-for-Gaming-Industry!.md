#  This Could be the Game that Changes How Games are Played Forever!

There is a new game that is being developed that has the potential to change how games are played. This game is called “Phoenix” and it is being created by a company called Inversus.

Phoenix is a 4-player competitive shooter where each player controls a different color of ship. The goal of the game is to capture the enemy’s flag while trying to protect your own.

What makes Phoenix unique is its ability to switch between two different game modes. In “Normal Mode”, players battle each other on a normal plane. However, in “Inverse Mode”, the planes are flipped and the players must battle each other on the back of their ships.

Inversus has been in development for over two years and it has already been showcased at various gaming conventions including PAX East and EGX. The game has received some positive feedback from both gamers and critics alike.

The developers of Inversus are currently raising money for the game through Kickstarter. They are looking to raise $40,000 in order to help finish development of the game. As of this writing, they have raised over $27,000 with 29 days left to go.

If you are interested in backing this project, you can head over to their Kickstarter page and pledge your support. You can also check out their website or Facebook page for more information on Phoenix and Inversus.
